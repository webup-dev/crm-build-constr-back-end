## Permission Level
Permission Level means that the user with this level has access to all data, functions of this levels.

## Additional required permissions
Some specialists must have specific permissions that not included in their Permissions level to make their professional tasks.
Such permissions are constant all-time as long as there are their professional tasks. Such permissions are hardcoded in the script.
If we will need temporary permissions then we create the appropriate permissions system in the next development stage as we decided earlier.
